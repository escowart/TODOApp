TODO Manager Application:
Author: Edwin Cowart

This Application was built to run on both iPhone and iPad devices. It was built using Xcode and is programmed in objective-C. The application allows the user to add new TODOs by pressing the plus button and remove TODOs by pressing the edit button on the main view of the app. The edit button allows one to select tasks to be deleted. Also one may click on any of the TODOs and view its description and deadline and also edit its fields.

The app was to have mechanism to move TODOs around the table but that is currently non-operational and commented out.
Import these files into XCode to run the simulated App.
